  title="Accessibility on the SAFE Acoustics website"
/>

This statement applies to content published on SAFE Acoustics. It does not apply
to content on the SAFE project main website. We want as many people as possible
to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- Resize the browser window to fit your screen
- Read about the project (on the about page) in an appropriate text size
- View imagery of the forest and species with alt text 
- Navigate the website through easily identifiable links

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device
easier to use if you have a disability.

## How accessible the website is

Parts of this website are not fully accessible. For example:

*	some pages and document attachments are not clearly written
*	some pages have poor colour contrast
*	some heading elements are not consistent
*	some images do not have good alternative text
*	some buttons do not have text descriptions

## What we do about known issues

We work to achieve and maintain WCAG 2.1 AA standards, but it is not always
possible for all our content to be accessible. Where content is not accessible,
we will state a reason, warn users and offer alternatives.

## Technical information about this website’s accessibility

The SAFE Acoustics website is committed to making its website accessible in
accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No.
2) Accessibility Regulations 2018. 

This website is not compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) AA standard. 

## Non accessible content

The front page, and about page both have significant amounts of content that may
cause accessibility issues. Please see the “Disproportionate burden” section for
further explanation.

Some documents and content are [exempt from the
regulations](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/4/made)
(such as live video content and PDFs or other documents published before 23
September 2018 if they’re not essential to providing our services), so we do not
currently have any plans to make them accessible. But if you need to access
information in one of these document types, you can contact us and ask for an
alternative format.

## Non compliance with the accessibility regulations

This website fails on multiple WCAG 2.1 success criteria. Unfortunately, there
are no current plans to ensure full compliance. Please see the “Disproportionate
burden” section for further explanation.

## Disproportionate burden

This website was developed as an output from an academic grant which has now
expired. We therefore do not have the appropriate funding to employ a developer
to fix every issue, nor do we have the web development skills in-house.

## Reporting accessibility issues

If you need information on this website in a different format like accessible
PDF, large print, easy read, audio recording or braille or if you find any
accessibility issues not listed on this page then please contact Sarab Sethi
[s.sethi16@imperial.ac.uk](s.sethi16@imperial.ac.uk) or Robert Ewers
[r.ewers@imperial.ac.uk](r.ewers@imperial.ac.uk).  
We’ll consider your request and get back to you within 14 working days.

## Enforcement procedure

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the
Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility
Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how
we respond to your complaint, [contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service
(EASS)](https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/).
